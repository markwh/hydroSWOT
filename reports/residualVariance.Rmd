```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Something that came out of playing around with variance equations. 


```{r}
i <- sample(names(ahgMods), 1)
foo <- ahgMods[[i]]

var(residuals(foo))

vw <- var(foo$model$logW)
b <- foo$coefficients[2]
vq <- var(foo$model$logQ)

vw - b^2*vq
```
