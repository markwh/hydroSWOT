The hydroSWOT dataset allows us to mine for the following prior distributions:

- Ao (conditional on W statistics)
    - lognormal with 
    - mu = 0.8549474 + 1.3925854 * lwbar - 1.7249043 * lwsd, 
    - sigma = 0.8229
- b (conditional on sd(logW))
    - beta with mean 0.0231 + 0.454 * sd(logW), variance 0.00975
- AHG error: (don't actually need this--see math)
    - relate to cor(logW, logQ)
    - $var(e_{ahg}) = var(logW) - b^2var(logQ)$
- logQ
    - hyperprior on mean
        - centered at logQWBM
        - spread?
    - hyperprior on variance
        - get from database
        - Here regulation structures, land-cover, slope?, climate would be useful
        - relate to var(logW)
- logn
- Manning error
- logQc
- logWc
